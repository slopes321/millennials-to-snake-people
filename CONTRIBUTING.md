## Things I would like help with

- Optimizing the regexes used for the text replacement
- Helping the extension work with edge cases on popular sites


## Things I am aware of

- Text replacement is aggressive and does not discriminate on what domains it runs on
- There is no indication that the extension is running other than text has been replaced
- There is no count of how many words have been changed, either on a given page or historically
